# Ambr贸sio, the bot

Ambr贸sio is a smart bot to be used in any situation you need. You can create your own Telegram bot, your own Terminal bot, whatever you want. 

Ambr贸sio has a list of Skills that you can create. Each skill has multiple rules, which is a regular expression associated with a callback method.

It also features multiple inputs and outputs, like Telegram and Console, right now. 

## Installation

 * Clone this repository
 * Run `pip install -r requirements.php`
 * Copy `config.yaml` to `config.yaml` and make Ambr贸sio your own. 
 
## How to run?

It's quite easy. After configuring it, just call `python ambrosio.py` and Ambrosio will boot.

__This is still a WIP and it's really alpha and early release. I have made this bot for my personal use, so it might have a lot of bugs and nearly zero documentation. Sorry about that!__
